<p>“A little learning is a dangerous thing:
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.”</p>
</div>

<p>This hackneyed distich is most frequently used to convey an idea
of that arrogant confidence which attends the first superficial acquisitions
in knowledge, and the characteristic diffidence of the profound
mind. Whether this is the impression intended to be conveyed by
its excellent author, it is not necessary to inquire: it evidently involves
a principle, which is illustrated by the history of every nation,
and has an important application to our own.</p>

<p>In tracing society through the various stages of its progress from
barbarism to civilization, we observe, almost universally, a point intermediate
between the two, where the foundations of the social system
seem to be broken up, and anarchy and confusion prevail.
Among men in a state of the greatest rudeness and ignorance, customs
and manners are comparatively permanent. Ages on ages roll
away, and the same simple institutions are handed down from father
to son with the most scrupulous care, and with scarcely a perceptible
change. In this condition of man prejudice holds universal sway.
The practice, or the ‘ipse dixit’ of a superior is the foundation upon
which they rest their belief, and the rule by which they govern
their actions; and in opinions resting upon such a basis, there is no
doubt or wavering. No intricate maze of reasoning leaves a dark
corner to beget distrust, but like the insect upon a flying fragment,
the contracted vision of the savage reaches not beyond the established
creed of his predecessors; and upon that, however far it may
be from reason and truth, he rests in secure repose. But when he
has obtained one glance beyond that rude fabric, he feels the trembling
of his basis, and his inquisitive mind becomes alive to all the
realities of his situation. He begins to reason&mdash;he begins to doubt&mdash;and
confidence once shaken in former belief, scepticism becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
universal. He is thrown upon the resources of his own rude mind;
prejudice wars with passion and impressions from the world, and
reason roams, and often roams in vain, in search of those pure principles
from which spring the happiness of enlightened communities.</p>

<p>In this incipient stage of knowledge, the field from which individuals
derive their impressions and opinions is contracted; and influenced
as they are by different circumstances and associations, it is
not surprising that their ideas should rarely concur. Mind clashes
with mind, and from this collision necessarily arises a popular effervescence.
But as knowledge advances, the horizon of each individual
extends farther and farther, and consequently coincides to a greater
extent with that of those around him. Hence, after this fiery ordeal
of revolution, in proportion as intelligence prevails, the sentiments
of the community harmonize, civil institutions become more
permanent, and society settles down into a peaceful, happy condition.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, but the brief outline of a theory; and like all other
theories, it requires great modification in its application to the world.
Man in his progress to civilization is not always influenced by the
same principles operating in the same way. In one instance, as he
breaks through the spell of prejudice&mdash;grasps the sword of reason,
and enters upon his rude analysis of mind and matter, he is directed
by some apparently fortuitous agency, at once to the elements of
peace and happiness, and advances in rapid strides from barbarism
to refinement. In another instance, in the same rude contest&mdash;the
same clashing of mental and physical energy, a nation falls exhausted
in the struggle, and sinks, if possible, to a state even more hopeless
than before. Nor is this period of revolutions confined to the
incipient stage of science in all its branches. Nations, that have apparently
past this eventful period, and settled down into the uniformity
of civilized life, are sometimes shaken to their very foundations, by the
agitation of some subject that had before escaped the trying test of
reason, and from some peculiar cause, been suffered to remain upon
the rotten foundation of prejudice and superstition. Indeed, no
nation is entirely secure from revolution until all its institutions are
established upon the basis of truth&mdash;of truth that is seen and felt by
the great body of the community.</p>

<p>The French revolution is, perhaps, as good an illustration of this
subject, as can be found in the annals of history. There we behold
a people not utterly buried in ignorance, but even taking the lead
in the sciences and arts, and apparently approaching the peace and
security of an enlightened state. But presently we are startled at
a horrid revolution sweeping over her. Religion and politics had
not yet undergone a strict examination. It is true, religious controversies
had been carried on, and wars, bloody and protracted, had
been waged between the Huguenots and Catholics; but they were
little more than the collision of prejudices, and the quarrels of priests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and princes. But when that doubting, ridiculing philosophy had
rent the veil of superstition, and, united with a gleam of liberty from
across the waters, had opened to the gaze of the multitude those
sinks of corruption, the people were exasperated at the wrongs which
they had before piously endured; they swept the land with unprecedented
fury, and hurled to one promiscuous ruin every monument of
royalty, nobility and priestcraft. But&mdash;alas for France! in that
eventful moment no kind genius appeared to direct the awakened
mind to the fountains of truth. Disgusted and maddened by the absurdities
and impositions of the church and state, they were driven
into the dreadful abyss of infidelity, and at last, in the recklessness
of despair, they relinquished the contest, and were ready to kiss a
yoke even more galling than the former. It is not our intention to
convey the idea, that the French revolution was in no way beneficial.
This is a question for a future age to decide. But we do intend
to assert, that a knowledge of literature and science merely,
however much they may contribute to it, is not sufficient for a nation’s
security; and that when man has been roused to investigation,
unless inexperienced reason is aided in its search after truth,
he is liable to fall into the most fatal errors. This height of civilization
has been attained only by the accumulated wisdom of ages, and
it is not, therefore, to be expected that unassisted reason will arrive
at it at once. Had not the French been left to be carried headlong
by the first transports of passion, or had the pure principles of religion
and freedom been presented in such a way as to be imbibed
and felt, they might have risen to a lofty elevation, and been able to
look back upon that horrid scene of anarchy and bloodshed only as
the harbinger of liberty and peace. As it is, she has only added
another illustration to the many that before existed, of the truth of
our motto&mdash;of the danger of rousing the inquisitive mind of man,
without providing the means and the opportunity of arriving at correct
conclusions in his inquiries. Man’s reason is not infallible; and
thus to awaken the attention of the ignorant or the inexperienced,
destroy their confidence in established institutions, and then leave
them to grope their own way to the fountains of truth, is like committing
to the breeze a ship without a helm, and expecting it to arrive
safe at its distant destined port.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that this subject has little application to a
country so enlightened as ours, and so accustomed to submit every
thing to the scrutiny of unbiassed reason. When we consider that
our institutions derive their origin from the most profound minds our
country has ever produced, and that they have prospered, for more
than half a century, beyond the most sanguine expectations of their
founders, we are apt to forget that the prosperity of all institutions
depends upon the attachment of the people, and to imagine that
ours are inherently secure. It would be Natural also to suppose,
that the discrepancies between different portions of the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
would gradually wear away by continual contact and free intercourse,
and that the longer we existed in our present condition, the
more consolidated and unanimous we should become. But the crisis
has not yet arrived. We have received these institutions upon the
faith of our fathers, and, hitherto, been engaged, not in fairly discussing,
but in eulogizing and defending them, without ever allowing ourselves
to doubt their excellence and superiority over all others.
These venerable fathers have now gone down to their graves; our
enemies have become our friends; the distorting medium of prejudice
through which we have hitherto viewed the world is removed,
and we are left to scrutinize at our leisure the fair fabric which has
been committed to us. Were this investigation to be candid and
serious, we should be safe. But he who has the least acquaintance
with human nature is aware, that when our complacency proceeds
from an influence prepossessing us in favor of an object, there is a
re-action in sentiment when that influence is removed: complacency
becomes disgust, and the more extravagant it has been, the more
powerful is the opposite bias. Upon this principle, we may account
for that complete change in the means by which power and influence
are sought from the people. Formerly, the only method of finding
favor with the multitude, was to enlist heart and hand in supporting
and extolling our glorious institutions; but he who would succeed in
pursuit of the same object, at the present day, must find some real
or imaginary imperfection, and by a torrent of ranting eloquence, display,
on every occasion, his superior sagacity in detecting the errors
of our fathers. Besides, the greater this blind confidence we have
acquired in our institutions, the more negligent shall we be in support
of them, and the more severe in exposing and decrying their
imperfections. Already we begin to hear, on the one hand, the
sneering taunt at the fickleness, inefficiency, and illiberality of our
proceedings, and the high encomium upon aristocracy and its concomitant
advantages, and on the other, the expression of envy
towards rising wealth and power, and utter contempt towards law
and all wholesome restraint. These floating insinuations are the
seeds of future public sentiment, and unless counteracted by a salutary
influence, the effect will be ruinous. It is true, we are an intelligent
people, and by no means blind to our own immediate interests;
but it is also indisputably certain, that the deliberate judgment
and profound thought of our predecessors have been, in some measure,
supplanted by a mere smattering of other men’s ideas. Precocious
demagogues and priests are taking the places of grave statesmen
and a sound, revered clergy. It is an idea instilled into us in
our childhood, and which we carry with us throughout our career,
that the present is an age far more effulgent than any that has before
dawned upon the world; and we therefore think ourselves warranted
in laying aside all past experience, and forming our conclusions
upon our own notions of expediency. The course of reasoning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
which led to the establishment of the noble institutions and customs
which have been handed down to us, is not at once comprehended,
and we resolve immediately to demolish, and substitute the
frail creations of our own fancy, which past experience and further
reflection show to be ruinous. In short, we have enjoyed the blessings
of our government just long enough to lose sight of the evils of
others, and are just wise enough to detect the imperfections of our
own system, without being able, from a deep sense of the injuries
under which every other people groans, to appreciate its excellence.
It becomes, then, every lover of his country, and, especially, him who,
in the prime of youth, is looking forward to it as the scene of a happy
life, with high hopes of honor and power, to beware how he lends his
aid to alienate public sentiment from this parent of his present joys
and future hopes, and to enlist heart and hand in support of a government
which has certainly, for more than half a century, secured to
this community a greater amount of happiness than was ever before
enjoyed by any portion of the earth’s population. The popular
judgment will be sufficiently severe under the most favorable circumstances.
When that is passed, and the people are satisfied from
their own examination, that the regulations which govern them are
the most perfect in existence, then, or at least not till then, may we
esteem the crisis past, and our country safe.</p>

<p>“Of all the several ways of beginning a book which, are now in practice
throughout the known world, I am confident my own way of doing it is the

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Reader</span>,</p>

<p>Should you, on any one of these gloomy spring evenings,
chance to traverse the college yard, between the hours of nine and
ten, among the many glowing windows, with which the sombre
buildings are then radiant, you may notice two, shining with transcendent
brilliancy. Of the situation of these windows, and the occasion
of so intense a glow, as to distinguish them from the dull
light diffused by the solitary study-lamp, it suits not with our purpose
to tell thee more than this: 1st, that they occupy a central position
in that building, which, in college mythos, holds the rank of
the third heaven; (to south middle we can assign no gentler appellative
than <i>purgatory</i>;) 2nd, that, in the day-time, they admit the
light <i>to</i>, and in the night season emit it <i>from</i>, one of the most literary,
best furnished, and withall best peopled rooms, which our well
stocked University can boast; and 3d, that at the hour above specified,
within this room are assembled four as merry, yet thoughtful
fellows, as your eye (especially if you be a little cynical) would desire
to look upon. But to speak of them in the high terms which
they deserve, would expose me to the charge of base flattery in the
case of three, and arrant egotism for the fourth. Further than this,
curious reader, except so far as may serve to elucidate the characters
of these Dii superi, we shall never communicate.</p>

<p>But, stop&mdash;my better judgment whispers me, that ’twould be safer
to satiate thy curiosity, at once, than have thee continually peering
about and asking troublesome questions. Enter, then, this mysterious
room&mdash;erect thy crest&mdash;quicken thy memory, for it must
serve thee in good stead. Thou hast free permission,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Each corner to search, and each nook to scan.’</p>
</div>

<p>Well, you have made your bow with such a trigonometrical flourish,
as proves indisputably your claim to a rectilineal descent from the
<i>Angles</i>&mdash;if I intended a pun, may I eat a dinner of cabbage and
quicksilver, and then, with my heels higher than my head, take a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
siesta beneath a Nubian sun on “Damien’s bed of steel;” (Dante
would have chuckled over so original a punishment, for the embellishment
of his Inferno.) Now you are in the room don’t open your
mouth with such a convulsive gape. Did you never see a classical
studio before? Drop your arms by your sides with perpendicular
propriety, and, if you wish to note the aspect of the room, and its occupants,
do it by quiet, occasional glances, and not by an Hibernian
stare. Take a seat&mdash;you have done it indeed, and with a most
rheumatic grace; one would think you had been studying the ‘Poetry
of motion’ all your days. If you wish to take an inventory of
the novelties you see, “<i>Accipe jam tabulas</i>”&mdash;pull out your memorandum
book,&mdash;“<i>detur nobis locus, hora, custodes</i>”&mdash;sit down, and
take your time about it, but be careful,&mdash;“<i>videamus, uter plus scribere
possit</i>”&mdash;see how fast you can write; that’s what my old <i>paedotribe</i>
used to call a <i>free translation</i>.</p>

<p>But we must hasten to a description of the room, and its contents.</p>

<p>Item. Your infernal extremities are sublevated by a carpet,
somewhat homely, but thick and warm, while from an open stove a
blazing pile of ‘divina Hickoria’ (as Virgil would call it) diffuses a
salutary warmth.</p>

<p>Item. Abutting upon either window, stand two tall and open
book-cases, “filled to the brim of contentment.” Beside the dull
and thumb-worn volumes of the ‘college course,’ which constitute
but a small portion of their burden, you will find a choice selection
from the infinity of books, which the wit of man has perpetrated.
The stolidity of wisdom, and the levity of wit, equally find there a
place.</p>

<p>Item. In the centre of the room rests a substantial table, around
whose broad circumference an astral lamp sheds its fluent splendors
upon a literary chaos, where taste and fancy have collected their
aliment,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">‘In embryon atoms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Light-armed, or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow’&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The meditations of Hervey, and the sparkling humor of Butler,&mdash;the
regal Virgil,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">‘With the sounding line&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long, majestic march, and energy divine,’&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the smart antithesis of Martial&mdash;the luscious flow of Ovid, and the
delicate indelicacy of Terence, and the ‘curiosa felicitas’ of Catullus&mdash;(the
phrase was first applied to Horace.) But we are exhausting
our critical knowledge, and thy patience&mdash;suffice it to say,
that, strown in elegant confusion, lie a motley assemblage&mdash;Milton
and the Comic Almanac&mdash;Coleridge and the President’s Message&mdash;Kent’s
Commentaries between the two volumes of Rienzi&mdash;Shakspeare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and John Bunyan&mdash;the Yale Literary Magazine and Tristram
Shandy, open at the page whence we extracted our motto.</p>

<p>Item. Stretching along the back side of the room, is a sofa, of
most dyspeptic virtues&mdash;hard by, is an arm-chair, expansive enough
for an alderman&mdash;and next, beneath a mirror, stands a dressing table,
which, besides the appliances of adscititious beauty, <i>eau de cologne</i>,
and “thine incomparable oil, Macassar,” supports a load of cups and
spoons, and other paraphernalia for the fruition of that rich beverage,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Which Jove now drinks, since Hebe spilt his nectar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Juno swears most bravely does affect her.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the same time, on the coals, is sweating and snoring a huge pot,
(the <i>conica tridentata</i> of naturalists,) like an uneasy slumberer, ‘<i>flagrantis
atroce horâ caniculæ</i>’&mdash;that is, about fly-time. Pray, reader,
remark my classic taste, which I have thus thrice developed for
your amusement.</p>

<p>We have thus slightly touched upon some of the most striking
phenomena which meet your eye. The living appurtenances of
the room demand a more careful and individual notice.</p>

<p>Close to one side of the stove, with his feet on the fender, and his
body ‘squat like a toad,’ in the easy embrace of an arm chair, sits a
singular personage, known to thee, at least, reader, by the fanciful
cognomen of Apple-Dumpling. He bears upon his plump visage
and stout frame, the impress of sensuality, struggling with, and almost
triumphing over, a good natural portion of intellect and refinement.
As you see him now, with a cigar in his mouth, and a volume
of Lamb’s in his hand&mdash;equally relishing the beauties of both&mdash;gazing
now and then, with pleasant anticipation gleaming in his eye,
upon the bubbling, hissing fountain, at his feet&mdash;and again with intellectual
delight, joining in the keen raillery of his companions&mdash;from
this short sketch, we say, you may divine his character. His personal
appearance is no less queer than his mental organization. He
is beneath the middle height, but owing to an odd habit, which he has,
of bobbing his head up and down, like a startled bullfrog, his height
is incessantly vibrating, between five feet, and five feet six. His hair
seems constantly electrified, and points in all directions, like glory in
the primer. A low forehead, thick lips, and a dull face, redeemed
only by the brightness of his eye, are the only peculiarities, which
deserve our notice. The worst thing about Apple is, that he is an
inveterate punster, and plumes himself on his proficiency in this execrable
art. You can always tell when to expect his artillery of wit.
He gives utterance to a sudden, energetic whiff, and knocks the ashes
fiercely from his cigar, whilst from his kindling eye there darts a
quick premonitory flash. He is frequently placed under our satirical
dissecting knife, and is, certainly, at times very ridiculous&mdash;yet,
with all his oddities and failings, we love Apple, ‘even as the apple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
of our eye,’ and should as soon think of throwing away our coffee-pot,
as of excluding him from our Quartette. Note with careful
eye the individual next him. He is an exquisite in personal appearance
and mental conformation. What ‘Poor Yorick’ said of Dr.
Slop and his pony, ‘that he never saw a better fit in his life,’ might
with equal propriety be predicated of this gentleman’s mind and
body. ‘Il Pulito’&mdash;for such is his appellative, drawn from his own
favorite Italian&mdash;possesses all the accomplishments of person and intellect,
which are essential to the perfection of a fine gentleman in
this most fastidious age. He has a <i>very general</i> knowledge of ancient
literature, and can <i>talk</i> fluently about French, Spanish, Italian,
and what not; but should one descend to <i>particulars</i>, he is most wofully
ignorant, or, as he calls it, <i>forgetful</i>. Dante, and Tasso, and
Schiller, and Richter, are names ever on his lips; but of any just
conception of their character, and their works, he is totally innocent.
In truth, his high pretensions will hardly bear a strict examination,
except in one particular. His knowledge of English literature is
thorough and extensive. He has drunk deep of those well-springs
of beauty and truth, the ‘Old English prose writers,’ lingered long
about the haunts of our vernacular Castalia, and plunged over head
and ears in the muddy pool of ‘transient literature.’ He is at no loss
for an opinion&mdash;most commonly a correct one, too, upon Lord Bolingbroke,
or Captain Marryatt&mdash;gentle Philip Sydney, or Porcupine
Cobbett&mdash;the cacophonous Chaucer, or the sweetly sentimental
‘L. E. L.’ With such attainments, and a certain seductive grace
in language and manners, Il Pulito is a most agreeable <i>collaborateur</i>
in our nocturnal toils. Were we to omit altogether a passing
notice of his <i>external</i> recommendations, and a sly hint at some of
his ‘labors of love,’ he would never forgive us! for on these he
prides himself incontinently. I would not hint that all his self-complacency
is absorbed in dress&mdash;yet he certainly <i>peacocks himself</i>,
as the Italians say, when he throws back the collar of his coat,
displaying thereby a fair round chest, from the middle of whose
glossy, <i>dipectoral</i> envelope glitters the golden symbol of <i>craniossal</i>
love. Dancing, music, drawing, and all the other <i>equivocal</i> graces
of ‘the gentleman,’ are as ‘familiar things’ to him. He can give
you a masterly criticism on a pretty foot, or a well turned arm, and
has caused alarming symptoms of a disease of the heart in more than
one of ‘Nature’s fair defects.’ I have often known the fellow fling
his dark locks around his brow in clustering beauty, and saunter
with <i>unstudied</i> carelessness among some half dozen of his fair acquaintance,
while the graceful dignity of his carriage, the significance
of his tone, and the eloquence of his eye, sent to the innocent
young heart a disturbing thrill, and called to the cheek a warm flush
of unconscious pleasure. Then, too, how perfect he is at turning a
sonnet. Il Pulito is a fine tasteful fellow, with a slight touch of
the dandy. In our coterie, however, he keeps his coxcombry, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
his love affairs pretty much to himself; for we would be loth to
admit any feminine sentimentalism, to mar our hearty, masculine
hilarity.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the stove sits the immortal Ego. Shall
I describe him&mdash;i. e. myself? I will, and that, too, in a manner
equally free from vanity and familiarity; for I have a respect for
myself not much inferior to that of the polite Spaniard, who took off
his hat whenever he spoke <i>of</i> or <i>to</i> himself. But to spare my feelings,
which are like the <i>sensitive Mimosa</i>&mdash;oh! simile most original
and sweet!&mdash;I must recur to the third person. His name is Nescio
Quod. His face when alone is grave and thoughtful; in company,
it is jolly and careless, yet crossed here and there by lines of serious
reflection, which, on the whole, form the general expression of his
countenance. He, as well as Il Pulito, has dipped into almost every
thing, and gone deeply into some&mdash;he has read extensively and foolishly,
and is, very naturally, infected with the itch of quoting. He
is apt to mistake strangeness of expression for originality of thought,
and when he has revived some obsolete phrase, or brought forth some
new-coined word, to which there are already a dozen synonymes, he
hugs himself as fondly as if he had struck out a brilliant witticism.
He is vague and anomalous&mdash;every thing except wise&mdash;sometimes
misanthrope, sometimes pedant, sometimes a musing poetico-philosopher,
but always his own miscellaneous self. He is fond of books,
as much from their generic nature, as from any specific merits they
may possess, and has always some conclusive reason for thinking the
last book presented to his notice, the best he ever saw in his life.
Is the book an old one? ’Tis the voice of antiquity&mdash;a message
from the past. Is the work fresh from the literary mint? It breathes
of novelty&mdash;its odor is refreshing. He is a very fluent writer, and
for this reason, though by no means the most elegant of the four, he
has been selected to commit to paper the annals of our doings.</p>

<p>The last of our coterie is called by mortals&mdash;no matter what;
among the Gods his name is Il Tristo. His soft hair hangs about
his face “unkempt” and tangled. His eye is faded, his cheek colorless.
Across his uneasy forehead flits momently, from dark to light,
each shade of passion.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And o’er that fair, broad brow are wrought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The intersected lines of thought&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those furrows which the burning share</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sorrow plows untimely there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now his face is dark with some bitter remembrance&mdash;now softened
by some tender thought&mdash;now lightened by some glorious purpose.
Tristo is pure and passionate. But his thin, light frame is too weak
for the agitations of his burning spirit. So far as I can learn, he has
been from boyhood the child of the feelings&mdash;“chewing the cud of
sweet and bitter fancies.” He has lived in an artificial world&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
world of poetry and romance. In spite of his good taste, his excitable
feelings and craving wishes lead him to dwell upon fictions
of wild and outrageous extravagance. This is not a world for the
gentle or wayward in heart, and Tristo’s plans and fancies are daily
crossed and crushed. Indeed, I sometimes think that his heart-strings
have been jarred by a terrible concussion, and will never vibrate more,
save in tones of mournful music. When in society, he usually represses
his moodiness, and his thoughts come forth with a fluent
brightness, which is purified and enhanced by their melancholy tinge.
In our company he is more frank and cheerful than elsewhere, and
will, at times, by his eloquence of feeling, call forth our sympathies
and excite our admiration. He never speaks heartlessly&mdash;his literary
opinions, his views of society, are all colored by his feelings&mdash;and
he will condemn a worthless publication, or espouse the cause
of a favorite author, with as much earnestness as if he were a party
in the case. His vehemence adds greatly to the life of our discussions,
and his caustic, yet good-natured wit, to the merriment of our
lighter moods.</p>

<p>“A fine essay that,” said Dumpling, as he threw down a volume
of Elia, accompanying the movement with a prolonged emission of
breath and smoke. “A masterly essay, that upon Shakspeare.
(Puff.) Lamb is, or <i>was</i>, by far the best critic of the nineteenth
century, not excepting Kit North himself. Wilson rants too much.
He leads us all over creation for treasures which he might as well
have given us at first. But the deep, quiet Lamb&mdash;(Puff, puff,
puff.) By the way, how advances the coffee, Nescio?” Nescio
roared, Pulito stroked his chin and laughed, while a quick, bright
smile beamed over the face of Tristo, at the characteristic transition.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Nescio, “I think it has reached its maximum of
excellence.”</p>

<p>“An excellent maxim that remark of yours,” said Apple, complacently,
thinking he saw a handle for a pun.</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Oh! Dumpling, don’t be witty, at least in that line.
Addison used to say that punning was the lowest species of wit.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Addison was an ass. (Puff.) Infund some coffee <i>instanter</i>.
How beautifully clear! ’Tis pure as Heaven.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Yes! I’ll wager my Kent’s Commentaries against Nat.
Willis’s poems, that not the <i>ordinaires</i> of London, the <i>restaurateurs</i>
of Paris, or the <i>cafès</i> of Madrid, can furnish better.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Ha! ha! One would think from that long array of ‘instances,’
that you were really a ‘man of travel,’ and were perfectly
at home in St. James’ Square or the Rue de St. Honorie.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I have heard of them, which is just as well.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Do you know, friend Quod, that we do wrong in drinking
coffee so transparent?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “No! how, I pray? Instruct us.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Why, we ought always to see the <i>grounds</i> of what we
imbibe.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Oh! spare us, incorrigible wretch. ‘Wilt never cease?’”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “How long were you loading that gun, Apple?”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Rest you content, <i>fair</i> sir. ’Twas an <i>improvisation</i>&mdash;a
direct inspiration from Mercury.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “The <i>mercury</i> must have been some degrees below zero,
I should guess.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Oh! most miserable! (Puff.) Physician, heal thyself.
You are like the man that preached against dishonesty with a stolen
shilling in his pocket.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Cease this ‘childish treble’&mdash;take another cup of coffee,
and then tell me what you think of ‘Tristram Shandy,’ which I have
found lying here on the sofa, ‘dejected and alone.’”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Think of it? (Puff.) What should I think of it, but
that it’s the finest book in the world? I prefer it to both Swift and
Smollett.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Well, now, in candor, I do not like it very much, nor
did I ever. I have sometimes stared at his strange conceits, and
laughed at his queer conjunctions, and been, in a few instances, actually
ravished by his beauty and his <i>naturalness</i>. But, then, look at
the astounding proofs of his thievish propensities&mdash;at his plagiarisms
from Rabelais, which were traced out by his English bloodhound;
and, whether original or borrowed, look at his tedious and fruitless
wanderings, enlivened, it is true, by conceptions as beautiful as they
are new, yet putting one out of patience and out of breath.”</p>

<p>I’ll tell you one thing, Mr. Quod. You and I must part if you say
any thing prejudicial to my beloved Laurence. Shakspeare, Fielding
and Sterne are my favorites <i>par eminence</i>, and ‘let my tongue
cleave,’ (puff)&mdash;‘let my right hand forget,’ (puff)&mdash;if I do not defend
them till&mdash;my last cigar&mdash;that is, in a quiet way, by swearing
to my belief, which is as firm as the laws of the Medes, or the determination
of a pig. As for logic, hang your silly syllogisms&mdash;hem!&mdash;I
would not <i>argue</i> the point, if Sterne were my grandfather.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Well, if you will not defend him, perhaps Tristo will.
What say you?”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Oh! There are parts and passages of glorious beauty!

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Yes&mdash;but those are in the Sentimental Journey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Right. It is some years since I read it. I have of late
been absorbed in poetry, wild fiction, and idle thinkings. Friend
Pulito, however, if you can waken him from his trance, will, doubtless,
be glad to enter the list with you&mdash;lance in rest.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “He must speak for himself. Come, Pulito, what think
you of the proposal?”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> (Musing.) “Why, I have hardly thought, yet, of <i>proposing</i>,
though she’s a deucedly pretty girl&mdash;Phoebus! what a face,
and what a dewy lip!”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> (Chuckling.) “You and she then might play a fine <i>dew-wet</i>
together.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> (Still gazing in his coffee-cup.) “True&mdash;she does sing
well&mdash;and then, such glossy hair, and that eye of jet.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “From that eye, then, we might expect to see a fine <i>jet
d’eau</i>.” [At this last discharge, Pulito was thoroughly awakened,
while the others wished they had been asleep.]</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Now you’re awake, Pulito, you will, perhaps, answer
my challenge.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Your challenge, my dear fellow? I heard none. But,
if it related, as Paley says, ‘either remotely or immediately’ to the
drinking of coffee, I’m ready for you ‘when and where thou wilt,
lad.’”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Pulito is either strangely forgetful, or ridiculously perverse
to-night. Let us enlighten the fellow. While your eyes were in
‘dim suffusion veiled,’ and you were <i>reverising</i> upon ‘sweet seventeen,’
Nescio has offered Apple and myself, pitched battle over
Sterne’s ‘Tristram Shandy.’ Apple refuses to fight, being like
Knickerbocker’s fumigating warriors, more valorous with the pipe,
than the sword, while I retire, inglorious, knowing nothing of this
‘bone of contention.’ Quod, who is determined to have ‘war of
words,’ next offers you the challenge.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Your pardon, Quod, for my inattention, and thanks to
you, Tristo, for your kind mediation. By the dark-eyed houries of
Mahomet’s heaven&mdash;by the beauty congregated in the harem of the
Sultan, (Pooh, interjected Dumpling,)&mdash;I never&mdash;what was I going
to say?&mdash;Oh! I never felt better disposed in my life to do literary
battle&mdash;for I have read the book through, within the last month,
and, faith, I believe I introduced the subject myself. I’ll uphold the
<i>old</i> novelists against all gainsayers and Bulwerites.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I do defy thee, stripling. As I myself once said, (rather
foolishly though,)</p>

<i>soul</i> of Wit, Philosophy, and Poetry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Bulwer a poet,” said Tristo&mdash;“have you read the Siamese
Twins?” “Bulwer a wit,” said Apple&mdash;“in all his novels, he has
no more than ten puns to a volume, on the average.” “Bulwer a
philosopher,” said Pulito&mdash;“Oh! shade of Locke!”</p>

<p>What further open maledictions or sly hits, the ‘favorite of the
periodical press’ and circulating libraries, might have received is uncertain.&mdash;Just
then a shout of <i>Fire</i>, which rung through the reechoing
halls of the building, roused our sympathies, and joining in the cry,
we rushed from the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_INFLUENCE_OF_MORAL_FEELING_UPON_THE_PLEASURES">
THE INFLUENCE OF MORAL FEELING UPON THE PLEASURES
OF THE IMAGINATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub"><span class="smcap">Essay No. I.</span></p>

<p>By moral feeling, we mean a recognition of those great principles
of right and wrong, which form the basis of our relation to each other
as social beings. When it is exhibited in our varied character of
members of a community, citizens of a commonwealth, and brethren
of the human family, we give it the specific names of benevolence,
patriotism, and philanthropy. Since then, these relations are so comprehensive,
and so necessarily blended and interwoven with all our
habits of thought and action, the influence of this feeling must extend
to most, if not to all the powers of the mind. It will be our
object in this series of essays, to demonstrate this influence as affecting
the pleasures of the imagination.</p>

<p>By the benignity of our Creator, we have been endowed with the
powers of taste and imagination, to throw a charm over the ruggedness
of human life, and bring in a thousand tributes of enjoyment to
cheer our hearts in our journeyings through this ‘vale of tears.’
These pleasures, as long as the powers themselves are uncorrupted
by vice, and their purity free from the taint of unhallowed passions,
are of a kind the most pure and innocent. We believe it to be an
immutable law, in all the operations of the mind, that the exercise
of our virtuous affections, as far as it is carried, induces the highest
possible degree of happiness which we are capable of feeling. Our
most exquisite enjoyments in Literature and the Fine Arts, will be
found to receive their origin from something which most directly
calls up virtuous associations; and in the beauties of the natural
world, those scenes prove the most delightful, which elevate our
contemplations to the infinite perfections of the ‘great First Cause.’</p>

<p>We would remark, that the influence of moral feeling tends to
heighten the pleasure which we derive from Eloquence and Poetry.
The pleasure which flows from these sources belongs to the highest
and purest order of intellectual enjoyments. They bear with them
a voice that wakes the soul to intense interest, now throwing over
its powers the inspiration of sublimity, and now floating around it in
tones as mellow and gentle as the last whisper of a summer breeze.
Who, as he has listened to the voice of the living speaker, and been
borne along on the full tide of eloquence at the will of the moving
spirit, has not felt his heart swell within him to a loftier expansion,
and his bosom throb with the pulsations of a new and more glorious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
intelligence? Who, as his imagination has drank in the sweet and
thrilling strains of the poet’s lyre, and his own spirit has caught the
glow of his burning aspirations, has not felt a yearning to soar above
and beyond the cold, sluggish atmosphere of sense, and mingle in
the fancied existence portrayed so winningly before him? There is
something in the ideal but splendid creations of poetry, embodying
in its images all that is sublime, and all that is beautiful in the world
of thought and of nature, that must ever strike within us a kindred
chord. It bids the dim and far off past roll back its tide of vanished
years, and centuries of almost forgotten ages pass again, with their
memorials, across the theatre of existence. Palmyra rises before us
from her ruin of ages, and her long deserted streets are thronged
once more by the congregated strangers from a thousand lands.
Rome, too, shakes off the yoke of Goth and Vandal, and resumes
her proud title of ‘mistress of the world.’ Again the lofty Capitol
is reared on the Tarpeian rock, the long and splendid triumphal
procession enters the gates of the temple of Jupiter, and Rome is
once more the ‘eternal city.’ Then we turn toward the classic
shores of Greece, and Athens, the ‘mother of the arts,’ opens her
splendors before us. The stately Parthenon, sublime in its proportions
and chastely beautiful in its Doric simplicity, still surmounts
the summit of the Acropolis. We roam with Plato through the
shades of Academia; we stray with Socrates along the banks of the
Ilissus; we enter the crowded forum, and listen to the soul-thrilling
eloquence of the ‘prince of orators.’ We need not waste words
to prove, that to the man of sensibility, there is a rich repast of intellectual
luxuries in such exercises of the imagination. But rich
as it is, there is one thing which can bestow a still higher flavor. It
is only when the orator rises in the kindling majesty of virtue, when
the soul of a patriot lightens in the flashing eye, when the wrongs of
the oppressed pour the flush of noble indignation over his brow, and
a nation’s voice is heard in the thunders of his eloquence, that we
can know the full power of his appeals, and receive our most exquisite
gratification. For by the very constitution of our mind, our
deepest sympathies can be excited only when the holier and lovelier
sensibilities of our being are awakened by the exhibition of moral
beauty. There is something so commanding, so godlike, in this
subservience of great talents to high and noble ends, that while the
graces and the fire of the orator delight the fancy and the taste, all
our better feelings are enlisted in the purity and exaltation of his
purpose. Thus also with the poet&mdash;it is only when a spirit from
above has breathed the inspiration over him, and his harp is tuned
to the minstrelsy of Holiness,&mdash;when in the glories of antiquity, the
ravages of time, and the mighty revolutions of empires, he leads us,
with tender sublimity of feeling, to trace the wonder workings of
that wisdom which ‘sees the end from the beginning’&mdash;that the
imagination revels in the fullness of its enjoyment.</p>

This tale is in the hand writing of my friend.</p>
</div>

<p>In one of my journeys through the western part of New Hampshire,
I chanced to put up for the night at a small farm-house about
five miles from the little village of W&mdash;&mdash;, and meeting with a
somewhat curious adventure there, I have resolved to record it. My
host was a little, fat faced, bustling, bandy-legged fellow, running
here and there, studious for my comforts, my humble servant, &amp;.c.
&amp;c.; and succeeding with his wife, a long, lank, sidling, vinegar-looking
creature, he made out to obtain for me the only spare room
in his house. Into this I was ushered with due importance, and
having taken a survey of the apartment, its nice new bed, newly
dusted candle-stand, oak bottomed chairs, and a high huge wardrobe,
which from its antiquated appearance I judged to have been
an heir-loom in the family for three centuries at least, I tossed my
saddle-bags into one corner, kicked off my heavy boots into the other,
and slipping my released feet into a pair of soft squirrel-skin slippers,
returned again to the kitchen. There I found my host and his
wife cosily seated over a sparkling fire, and from the abrupt breaking
off of their conversation and half guilty countenances, I concluded
they had been talking over the character of their new comer. I
was never difficult to please, especially when I had fallen in with
any of the peasantry, so to speak, of dear New England, and admitted
to the calm content which reigns around their fire sides&mdash;so planting
myself upon a settle, perhaps a dye-tub, a thing indispensible
to a New England farm-house, I entered into conversation with
them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>
<p>I found my host a well bred, sensible fellow, somewhat free in the
use of provincialisms, and not wanting in love to a good broad-faced
joke; somewhat witty withal, and a memory in which he had stored
many an odd story, some good and some bad, which stories he told
(when solicited) with a tolerably good grace.</p>

<p>I pause here to record my observations on one of the peculiarities
in the New England character&mdash;I mean its modesty. Foreigners,
and residents of other parts of this widely extended territory may
talk of Yankee impudence, but for the life of me, in all my wanderings,
I could never find the genuine modesty of a native New Englander.
They may cheat you&mdash;that is, some of them may, some of
their outlawed, who with trunk and tin wagon travel into other
States to prey on the unwary; but where turn you and find not
some, who do and ever will disgrace the soil that nursed them? For
New England I claim no entire exemption; perfection is not beneath
the sun: but there is more of it here than elsewhere&mdash;and in
proof of it I adduce, their superior sagacity, their nobler intelligence.
Where intelligence is found, will you find least of the weaknesses of
human nature.</p>

<p>But to return: having bid Bessy, a short, flaxen-haired, chubby-cheeked
damsel, of about fourteen, the very image of her father,
bring him a cup of cider; and poking our chairs close into the fire&mdash;so
close that the wind which came down chimney, would now and
then puff out the smoke and curl it up about mine host’s neck and
shoulders, making him look for all the world like Vulcan peeping
through the clouds of his own smithy&mdash;he began as follows.</p>

<p>‘Late last March and on one of the coldest nights in my memory,
my wife and me were startled by a loud knock at the door, about
nine o’ the clock; and more so by the abrupt entrance of a stranger,
who had been as it seems just ceremonious enough to knock,
but not sufficiently so to wait until bidden a welcome. Marching
directly up to the fire he doffed his cap, and then in a bland, gentle
voice, and the language of a gentleman, prayed our pardons for his
boldness, and craved our hospitality.</p>

<p>‘Now Biddy here is not the most hospitable in her feelings, but
even she was softened by the coldness of the weather, and the soft
accents of the stranger. So, bidding him welcome and placing before
him such entertainment as we best could, he ate his meal and
then sat himself down&mdash;right where you are, sir, at this moment&mdash;as
if for conversation.</p>

<p>‘His age, I should think, was about forty five. In person he was
strikingly handsome, yet care-worn; his hair was black&mdash;his eyes
likewise, and a somewhat cynical curl about his small mouth made
you hesitate to address him, thinking he was perhaps a person of
strong prejudices. His skin was as fair as a girl’s; a fine set of
teeth were displayed when he smiled; in short, his appearance was
such that I should have taken him, perhaps, for a scholar; for,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
though his dress was rich it was careless, and there was a sort of
method in what he said though the subjects were simple, as I am
told is ever found in men of education. At first, he was very taciturn.</p>

<p>“You find it a cold air, sir,” said I, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’ve ridden far?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re come from the south, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re not from York, I guess?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes, sir.”</p>

<p>‘Well, thinks I, you may be a scholar for aught I know, but hang
me! if I think there’s much variety in your talk.</p>

<p>‘I took him on another tack.</p>

<p>“You have, at least, sir, come where hearts are warm, and hospitality
is proffered cheerfully.”</p>

<p>‘He started at this; a gentle flush tinged his cheek; and he seemed
struck with an ingenuous consciousness of his want of courtesy.
Turning to me he took my hand in his, and pressing it, replied&mdash;</p>

<p>“An honest heart, sir, is its own reward. Small boots it then,
that I add <i>my</i> sense of your hospitality to that of your own consciousness.
Yet such as I have, I give, and that is but small; for I
am one, sir, who cares but for a few, and one who is as little cared
for by others. Once I had a heart that&mdash;that&mdash;yes! that <i>felt</i>&mdash;in
every pulsation <i>felt</i> the beauty that is in morals and in virtue.
Nothing lived, but it gave me happiness; nothing died, but it gave
me pain&mdash;<i>That time is past</i>.”</p>

<p>‘There was something so earnest, yet unstudied; so easy, yet
solemn, and ‘heart-twinging,’ to use a phrase of Biddy’s, in this,
that both she and me began to water about the eyes like two babies.</p>

<p>‘Returning the kind pressure of his hand, I said&mdash;</p>

<p>“But you are young, sir&mdash;too young to feel that life has no claims
upon&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Too old&mdash;too old, sir,” interrupted he with emphasis, “too old
for earth, and too wise to do any good in it. Some of the world,
sir, live faster than others. Grief can crowd twenty years into ten,
and care make the vigor of manhood, the tottering imbecility of four
score. Believe it not&mdash;believe it not; they err, sir, who measure
life by years. Events, events notch it right&mdash;these notch the chronicle
of human life.”</p>

<p>“And yet, sir, ’tis man’s right to be always happy.”</p>

<p>“Aye! and ’tis the right of the singing bird to skim the blue
ether, and pour its music in concert with the harmony of the stars&mdash;but
how many things invade that right! The bird that sings sweetly
of a morning, may be jammed into the wallet of the clown, by
evening&mdash;its music hushed, and its mottled plumes dabbled with dirt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
and gore. Man’s prerogative to be happy! aye&mdash;<i>but ’tis his necessity
to be miserable</i>.”</p>

<p>‘This, sir,’ said my host, ‘may give you some idea of his character.
The evening passed off&mdash;though not very happily; for there
was that about him which took hold of my feelings, and when I
shook hands with him for the night there was an ache in my bosom,
I could’nt well get rid of.</p>

<p>‘In the morning, he was up betimes&mdash;breakfasted&mdash;and rose to
depart. Before he went however, he took from his bosom a paper;
and handing it to me, bade me keep it till his return. ‘It is a short
sketch of some of the events of my life,’ rejoined he, as he mounted
his horse, ‘and though it benefit you not, it will perform at least
one good office&mdash;make you remember me.’ He bowed, and rode away.</p>

<p>‘That paper I have now somewhere, and if you wish, sir, I will
read it to you.’ My host rose, and going to a huge cat-hole, or cupboard
in the corner of the room, he succeeded in finding it&mdash;not forgetting
by the way, to tumble out sundry articles of house-wife
memory, such as balls of yarn, woollen stockings, flannels, and night-caps,
and strewing them over the floor. Seated again by the comfortable
fire, he now put on a huge pair of brass spectacles, blew his
nose thrice, and proceeded to decipher&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE STRANGER’S MANUSCRIPT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I pass over my boyhood.</p>

<p>‘I had now entered upon my sixteenth spring, and with less unhappiness,
perchance, than ordinarily meets us in this world. Sadness
I had known, but unkindness I had never felt; nor had a suspicion
of how very opposed the heart is to rectitude, found a lodgment in
my mind. I was on the point of visiting the metropolis; and I
know I felt as boys mostly do on their entering into the great world&mdash;elated
with the thoughts of what I was to see and meet with, in a
scene I had heard so much about. I talked of little else; and when
the day came heralded by a morning of unusual loveliness, my happiness
almost sickened me. I remember I went out into the fields,
and every thing looked gayer and brighter than I had ever seen it.
The flowers looked prettier&mdash;the dew was brighter&mdash;the birds chirped
to me as I passed them&mdash;and a subtle spirit of life seemed to pervade
all things and participate in my happiness. I returned home
happy, and strove to while off the hours preceding my departure
(for I was not to leave till the afternoon)&mdash;but ere that afternoon
came, a dingy, dusky atmosphere, spread itself all about the earth,
and the very sky looked, as I thought, fiendish&mdash;threatening. I
shall not soon forget how soon it was communicated to my feelings.
My spirits sunk down. A fearful change seemed working itself
through my disposition, which amazed and maddened me. I answered
those sharply, who interrogated me as to the cause of it. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
gave my orders harshly. I ran from room to room, absent and
thoughtful. In fine, all my characteristic amiableness had gone from
me, and I seemed transformed into something devilish. I was changed
as I suppose those spirits will be at the last day, when they turn
half hoping to the judgment seat, and, reading their condemnation
there, instantly become fiends.</p>

<p>‘A gentle tap was heard at the door, and my mother glided silently
into the room; and seating herself beside me, she laid my head upon
her bosom. She parted the dark curls from my forehead, and I felt
her lips pressed feverishly upon it, and a tear fell upon my face&mdash;one
of her tears! I opened my eyes at this and looked her full in
the face&mdash;O! how she looked&mdash;pale&mdash;wan&mdash;beautiful.</p>

<p>“My son&mdash;my son&mdash;speak to me”&mdash;Staring her full in the face, I
drew my hand half unconsciously over my eyes&mdash;then, recollection
suddenly returning, I knelt wildly at her feet&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your blessing&mdash;Mother!” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Bless thee&mdash;bless thee&mdash;my boy!” I started up&mdash;screamed&mdash;and
fled from the room. It seemed as if I was mad at her&mdash;mad
even in my idolatry; and I verily believe I struck her, for I heard
her groan and fall heavily upon the floor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘Before I slept I was upon the ocean&mdash;and I have a dim recollection
that there was a storm&mdash;that the green and crested billows hissed
angrily as the thunder growled over them&mdash;that the ship went forward
like a mad horse plowing through whole mountains of water,
and shaking off the white surf from her bows in sheets of silver&mdash;and
I remember that the violence of the tempest seemed to harmonize
awfully with the loud passions within me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘Years had passed. The bright enthusiasm of youth had gone off
with them. The glowing thoughts, passions, sympathies, consuming
themselves in their own fire&mdash;my whole character had saddened
down into the melancholy, homeless wanderer. I was no longer
the sunny featured boy that had spent so many pleasant hours on
the hill side&mdash;by the sandy margin of the lake that washed its base
and sent up there with every wind that fanned it, a gentle lullaby&mdash;by
the rivulet that in early days had caught my laughing features as
I bent over it to gather water flowers&mdash;no! I was that boy no longer.
The peace which had once lived in my heart, had become a
worthless and withered flower, scentless as a shadow; the innocency
which once gave a zest to every thing had gone from me;
the gray hairs of premature age were intermingled with the dark
ones of my youth&mdash;no! I was that boy no longer. I had traveled&mdash;but
what was travel to me? I had been in the north and south, in
the east and west; I had wandered over the solemn grounds of Corcyra,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
and amid the classic ruins of Italy; I had stood beneath the
sky of Africa and sat me down like Marius amid the relics of her
better days, and tried to wake in my heart some of that dormant enthusiasm
belonging to young minds; but it was like seeking to resuscitate
the dead dust in the earth beneath, or to call life into the
mouldering mausoleums and temples around me&mdash;no! I was that
boy no longer.</p>

<p>‘The time of the grain gathering had gone by, and later Autumn
had fully set in; for the trees were more than half stripped of that
gorgeous covering peculiar to this season; and no music came out
from the forest save the whistle of a single quail, and this too in
that pensive cadence which is heard only at the close of the year.
I was revisiting the scenes of my childhood&mdash;a spot I had not seen
for twenty years, and during which period I had been a wanderer
where no tidings of the weal or wo of my family reached me. It is
not necessary to recount the circumstances which had made me
thus long a voluntary exile. It need only be said, I parted from
home and all I held dear, in anger&mdash;angry with self&mdash;angry with
man&mdash;angry with that pure and exemplary being who had borne me
on her heart, and by whom I had been so often taught to kneel and
pray even before I could myself frame a benediction&mdash;‘with her
who taught me that God loved obedient children.’ O! that one offence!
Any thing else&mdash;had it been any thing else, I had suppressed
the groans over my nightly pillow, and borne it like a man
while it grieved me. But she, she in whose character unkindness
had no part&mdash;a blow, a damning blow&mdash;God! God! this was unmitigated
misery. And yet I had suffered&mdash;God knows it, year after
year, and seen it preying on my health, and felt it withering up all
my finer sensibilities&mdash;and yet I would not return. I could not. I
felt as if a power was upon me, against which my united energies
were nothing. I felt as if it was my destiny, and strange as it may
appear, I thought it right. I felt it certain that home was not for
me, and though I would wake from an unrefreshing sleep, and recount
for hours as a miser his gold every early association, it brought
the wish but not the purpose to return. Sickness came&mdash;O! what
a leveler is sickness of all the petty passions and enmities which
creep into the dispositions of men! How it tears up the character,
wrings out from the hardened heart the bitter gall of contrition, and
forces into amendment! Sickness accomplished in me what reason
and conscience could not do, and broke down that indomitable barrier
which had so long interposed betwixt me and duty. I rose from
my bed, a habitant rather of another world than the denizen of this,
and my first thought was home. This cherished for a few weeks
grew into a passion, and the fear that the grave had closed over all
I loved magnified the wish a thousand fold, while every obstacle
which now interposed betwixt me and a return sent a chill through
me, like that which we may suppose lies on the heart of the dead.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
The swiftest speed seemed but delay, and it was only on the last
day of my journey and I neared home that my impatience subsided,
and my anxiety began to assume another form&mdash;something terrible
and strange, foreboding and oppressive.</p>

<p>‘The tread of the post horses down the gravelly slope which led
directly to the village, roused me from a lethargy I had fallen into,
and I sprang to the coach window like a madman. We were opposite
the village inn. The same old antiquated elm creaked before
the door, and the same old sign board flapped in the blast, and upon
the high step stones that led to the main body of the building, sat a
human form. A staff lay on the ground beside him&mdash;his ragged
scrip was at his feet&mdash;and his form was doubled up with age. I
looked closely&mdash;God of Heaven!&mdash;<i>it was my brother</i>.</p>

<p>‘But my cup was not yet full. We drew up at the inn door, and
I heard the guard rudely order the beggar from the spot, and curse
him for an idle mendicant. This was too much for my swollen heart
to bear, and leaping from the opposite side of the carriage, I took
my way forward alone. I came to the small hill which ran along
by the side of the village, from the top of which the immediate valley
where lay my father’s dwelling appeared in view; and as I paused
there for a moment, and memory ran over the thousand senseless
objects that lay around me with each of which I could associate a
forgotten happiness, I thought death a boon I could have prayed for.
At that moment the village school poured forth its groups of noisy
and innocent children. This was as it was wont to be&mdash;this seemed
natural. But looking nearer, I knew them not&mdash;they were strangers.
Here and there I thought I recognized a face I had once
known, but it was transient and soon passed&mdash;all was strange. A
celebrated ‘Retreat for the Insane’ was in our village, and reaching
the summit of the hill I stood by its walls. The door was closed
but not fastened; and I know not why, but an indefinable feeling
led me to enter there. I know not but it was the unbreathed wish
of my heart to witness some spectacle of human suffering&mdash;hoping
thereby to lessen my own; perhaps I thought I might soon make
it my own dwelling, and I wanted to familiarize the objects I should
meet with;&mdash;but I entered. Seated upon the ground with scarce a
mat to cover them, was a lot of wretched beings busied as their
several dispositions prompted them. One was blowing bubbles&mdash;he
said he was maturing a system of astronomy, whereby Galileo should
be forgotten and the world profited. Another was heaping up sand,
and hoarding it in his bosom&mdash;he called it gold. A third it seemed
had been a lay preacher, and now and then he howled forth a torrent
of truth and error, interlarded with imprecations and blasphemies
the most horrid. And there was one there, a tall and handsome
youth, with eyes as black as midnight, and his brow drawn
down into the scowl of a demon&mdash;He said he was <span class="allsmcap">ANALYZING A HUMAN
HEART</span>. Sudden my ears were saluted with loud and piercing
shrieks that made my whole frame shiver, and betwixt each scream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
I thought I recognized the shrill echo of a lash as applied to the
naked skin. Another&mdash;and an old man came tottering round an
angle of the building; and seeing me, he ran to my feet and cowered
down like a whipped hound seeking for protection.</p>

<p>“Curse them for inhuman wretches”&mdash;groaned, or rather screamed
the old man&mdash;“They chain me up like a vile beast&mdash;a dog to murder
me. They drag me into that black den and shut me there, and
say I’m crazed&mdash;mad. What is mad? Who?&mdash;O! yes,&mdash;my children,
they broke my heart&mdash;one went from me, and the other&mdash;Ah!
save me&mdash;save me”&mdash;His keepers came in sight, and in their
hands were the scourges they had been using, the sounds of which
had rung in my ears so appalling. “O! don’t&mdash;don’t&mdash;I’ll follow&mdash;you
won’t whip me, will you master&mdash;I’m good&mdash;good”&mdash;and the
old man actually knelt down, and like a beast licked the feet of his
tormentors. I fell to the earth senseless.</p>

<p>‘A long and doleful night followed&mdash;a blank&mdash;a vacancy; so long,
it seemed ten thousand eternities; so gloomy, it seemed as if the
darkness was consolidated. O! what a night is that, when the
helm of reason breaks&mdash;the unshackled faculties wander forth&mdash;and
the maddened powers invoke images of horror, only to madden
themselves the more by gazing at them! All that is grand&mdash;all
that is terrible&mdash;all horrible, loathsome, fearful images, that the mind
had ever while healthy repulsed, then come back on the heart
like vultures that have been scared awhile from their prey, whose
fasts have only whetted their ungorged appetites. At one moment,
I seemed borne through the Eternal void chained to the lightnings;
at another, I was dashing downward towards a tremendous barrier
of cavernous rocks, and their serrated pinnacles seemed waiting
to embrace me. Now I was tossed on billows of fire, and a tremendous
surge would hurl me on a jagged precipice; then with its reflux
suck me down through unimaginable depths, and the hot fires
scorched me as they shot into my brain. Again I heard peals of
laughter, and howlings of formless, shapeless beings that hovered
around me; they had snakes and basilisks twisted round their foreheads,
and the flames that issued from their forked mouths seemed
to burn into my very soul. Then came the sense of a release&mdash;the
gasping, choking, horrible consciousness, that you are struggling
on the confines of two worlds, and not knowing which is to be yours&mdash;whether
earth or death shall have you. Suddenly a fountain
seemed tossing its cool spray over me&mdash;the fires that withered up my
brain went out&mdash;the fiends that howled about me passed away&mdash;the
subtlest life began to dance through my veins&mdash;and I awoke!</p>

<p>My first thoughts were true to their mark, and my first words,
“Mother, lives she? The rest&mdash;father, brother&mdash;God of Heaven!
why was I reserved for it?”</p>

<p>‘A form stood by me&mdash;a little maid. O! how the innocent words
and kind attentions of infancy, soothe the pillow of an irritable sickness!
We can’t bear the cold studied kindness of such as we are,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
we are jealous of them; we fear they will condole with us, curse
us with their stinted pity; and that too in the measured phraseology
which speaks of the head and not of the heart. But a child, a
gentle child&mdash;to see its little form gliding about your couch&mdash;to feel
its little arms about your pillow&mdash;to catch its warm breath on your
cheek as winds breathed from flowers&mdash;and see the kind and touching
solicitude of the eye unused to sights of sorrow, yet enduring it
like a martyr, and for ourselves too,&mdash;these make irritable diseases
tolerable&mdash;may I not say happy? for the evidence of a pure and devoted
affection in a human being, makes a misanthrope (and such I then
was) contented with misery. And my disease was of this nature:
it was a nervousness induced by excess of suffering, and my faculties
had become so exquisite, that the least thing sent a dart through
me that seemed tearing flesh and soul asunder.</p>

<p>“Mother! is she&mdash;?” excessive weakness forbade me finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>“Your mother lives”&mdash;but she placed her finger upon her lips in
token of silence. I attempted to answer&mdash;she laid her hand upon
my mouth with a sweet smile, then turned and left the room.</p>

<p>‘Weeks passed, and still was I the denizen of a sick room; and
but slowly regaining my pristine energies. My form had shrunk
away&mdash;my eyes were sunk&mdash;my voice was almost entirely gone; and
as I slowly paced my apartment and from the window threw my
eyes on the dreariness without, (for the year had gone far into later
fall, and the loud winds whistled bitterly through the naked poplars)
I felt as if I had but little to do in the world, and would as lief
go from it. But yet, one thing held me back, one thirst, one
burning desire&mdash;the wish to see my mother. She I had not seen,
and for reasons I could not unravel, her name was never mentioned.
And though I was told she was in the house, I was not suffered
to visit her. She was sick, but not dangerous&mdash;received my messages
of love daily&mdash;returned them&mdash;this was all.</p>

<p>‘One dark night (I shall not forget that night) I was sitting up in
bed, and counting off the weary hours as they limped laggingly by
me. A weight had been on my heart all day, and racking fires had
seemed scorching my brain; and so acute was the suffering, as if a
band of hot iron were riveted closely round my forehead. I sat
thinking&mdash;thinking of self&mdash;of my sorrows&mdash;of my strange destiny;
and then there came back to me the remembrance of other days,
and with them my mother&mdash;her care, love, and early tenderness,
until my eyes were suffused with tears. Sudden I was startled by a
low sigh breathed as it were close in my ears. I thought it delusion,
but was soon undeceived&mdash;for it was repeated, and that too
so audibly I could not mistake. I turned my eyes in the direction
from whence it came. Again I caught it, and a strain of music rose
soft and sweetly as if an angel sang it, and I saw indistinctly a shadow
gliding past me. Then my name was distinctly sounded, and in
a voice I knew too well. Terror had chained the powers of utterance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and I only gazed at vacancy with all the horrors of some dark,
indefinite foreboding. The same sigh was repeated and the name,
and then as a cloud passed over the moon, a figure stood in the
apartment clad in the habiliments of the grave. It smiled sweetly
upon me&mdash;it was my mother! I knew she must have passed from
this to a better world, and the truth came over me with a cold
sweat while the palsy of my limbs made the very bed tremble. I
spread out my arms in agony, and wildly clasped the air. There
was another sigh, the repetition of my name&mdash;and the figure vanished.</p>

<p>‘I rose and threw my night garments round me, and grasping my
own flesh to be sure I dreamed not, I took the light from my table
and commenced a search to find&mdash;what? my mother’s corse! for
such I felt I must find her, if at all&mdash;the warning was not for nothing.
I traversed room after room&mdash;met no one&mdash;and came to the
wing of the building where I had ever deemed she lodged; and
leaving the light at the door, I slowly lifted the latch and entered the
apartment. <i>On a bed in the centre of the chamber, she lay lifeless.</i>
There was no light there, but the moon broke forth at the moment,
and I saw she was shrouded for the grave.</p>

<p>‘O! death!&mdash;death!&mdash;how solemn thou art! How awful, when
thou comest on those we love! How thought at such moments
crowds on the living! How the words that once issued from the
lips that lie there, come up to recollection! How the eye that
looks so chill and glassy, gleams again&mdash;and the face marble-cold
and as expressionless, radiates with love, hope, happiness! There
she lay dead, dead&mdash;and I not forgiven. She was gone. I had not
heard her say, ‘I forgive thee, boy.’ Not a word&mdash;not a look&mdash;not
a blessing&mdash;God! God!&mdash;what next! O, what next!</p>

<p>‘I crept up to the bier and laid my cold face down to hers, and
moaned in all my heart brokenness of sorrow. I kissed her&mdash;I
shrieked her name&mdash;I stamped&mdash;I threw myself upon her corse.
There was no Promethean heat that could reanimate it&mdash;and I <i>felt</i> I
was alone.</p>

<p>‘Had I heard her say, ‘I forgive&mdash;I bless thee, child’&mdash;life were
tolerable, and I would have breasted the forceful waves of misery as
they came tumbling in upon me, like a man. This was denied me,
and in its place is blazed in shapes of fire&mdash;<span class="smcap">That one offence</span>.’</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The evening wore away, what with the reading of the manuscript
and my many inquiries concerning the stranger, and my host now
showing me to my room, where with many expressions of his happiness
to wait upon me, &amp;c. &amp;c. he bade me good night, I jumped
into bed. In the morning I met him again and tried my hand with
him at a good, honest, hearty, New Hampshire breakfast; afterwards
I shook hands with his family, mounted my horse, and continued my
journey&mdash;and such was my ‘Night at the Farm House.’</p>

<p class="h2sub"><i>The Culprit Fay, and other Poems</i>; by <span class="smcap">Joseph Rodman Drake</span>.
New York: George Dearborn, Publisher. 1835.</p>

<p>Over the grave of a highly-gifted and a youthful poet, gathers
many a delightful and yet saddened reminiscence. It should ever
be regarded as a consecrated spot&mdash;crowded with associations of no
ordinary character&mdash;hallowed by the deepest and the tenderest of
feelings. It is <i>holy</i> ground,&mdash;better fitted, it may be, than any other
to allure us to reflection,&mdash;to summon into active exercise each deep
emotion of the heart,&mdash;to draw out into living forms of beauty each
hidden power, each finer sensibility,&mdash;and to leave us, better, purer,
nobler, for its warnings and instructions. And yet, why should it be
so? The grave even of the young, the gifted, and the beautiful,
differs not in outward fashion or adornment, from the many which
surround it. It is hollowed out from the same earth with them&mdash;closes
over the same lifeless and decaying bodies&mdash;furnishes the
same victim for the worm, the same banquet for corruption. The
sculptured stone that marks it, is as soon to sink or crumble as another&mdash;the
grass grows over it no greener&mdash;the steps of the idle and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the thoughtless fall not round it with a lighter tread&mdash;and the flower
that blooms upon it, is as soon to fade or wither.</p>

<p>The grave of a youthful poet is indeed a holy spot, but it is so
not alone in reference to the moldering body it enshrouds, or to the
impressive comment that it reads on death. That grave is sacred,
rather as a remembrancer of intellect. That body was the outward
vesture of a mind. It was the drapery that imprisoned in its folds
a restless and a struggling spirit, burning with the fires of heaven,
yet amid the gloom of earth, and was thrown aside when tarnished,
as unfitted for its purpose. In the departure of that spirit, who can
tell our loss. How brilliant, yet how rapid, has been its career.
Meteor-like, it has vanished from our sight, while the hopes that we
had cherished have gone down for ever.</p>

<p>The volume, whose title we have placed at the commencement of
this article, and whose merits we propose to examine with our readers,
is a beautiful memorial of departed genius. The perusal of its
pages has naturally led us to indulge in those reflections we have
hitherto pursued. The memory of Drake&mdash;his early and untimely
grave&mdash;has tended to associate with his, the same sad fate of others.
We have thought of Sands, of Wilcox, and of Brainerd. Of the
former, it is true, we know but little&mdash;nothing more than a few casual
examinations of their works afford us. Of the latter, we know
more. We delight to speak of him, not only as a poet&mdash;and as such
he had few equals&mdash;but still farther, as a friend. In the first of these
characters he has now been long before the public, and has gained
from their decisions a conspicuous distinction&mdash;a rank higher we believe
than his own expectations, although one of strictest justice and
commensurate with merit. To us it is a matter of no slight regret,
that a mind so richly-gifted, should have garnered up its beauties,
and have been so very sparing of its splendid treasures. Brainerd
was distrustful of his own abilities. The hope of approbation, was
with him no motive to exertion. He cared not to lay bare the workings
of a heart, perhaps too warm and sensitive, or to send abroad
those finer feelings which might meet no kindred sympathies, and
return to him companionless from contact with the world. It was
only in those moments given up to the full flow of friendship&mdash;to
the interchange of sentiments with more intimate associates&mdash;that
the noblest of his qualities became developed. As a poet, he reminds
us forcibly of Burns. His was the same appreciation of the
charms of nature&mdash;the same exquisitely tempered sensibility&mdash;a like
generosity of disposition, and as much of poignant wit and versatility.
The tribute paid to the memory of Burns, may with equal
justice be applied to Brainerd.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And his that music to whose tone</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>
    <div class="verse indent2">The common pulse of man keeps time,</div>

<p>When an edition of Drake’s poems, containing many pages hitherto
unpublished, was announced as nearly ready for the press, we
received the information with great pleasure. We expected much,
and we are glad to say our expectations have been realized. The
first thing which arrested our attention was the dedication, and it
struck us at the time as unusually appropriate. It is a happy testimonial
of respect, from a daughter to her father’s friend&mdash;to one
who, perhaps, above all others, best deserved the appellation. To
whom should it have been dedicated, if not to Halleck? To the
community at large the loss of such a man as Drake may be regarded
as a great calamity,&mdash;but to the cause of literature it is still more.
It is taking from the latter one of its highest ornaments, and leaving
a wide vacancy, which time may never fill. Of his general merits,
as a writer, there can be but one opinion. The precise rank to which
he is entitled we propose not to examine, or to venture on comparisons
with critical minuteness. The exact extent of his abilities, or
the results to which his genius might have led him, we would leave
as questions to be settled by the taste of his admirers, and proceed
to mention some of those peculiar features which stand out in his
productions. In our view, his poems are distinguished for uncommon
ease of diction, and the richness of their imagery. Over the
wide realm of imagination our author seems to hold unlimited control,
and to gather from it beauties, which he scatters with profusion.
In whatever spot his fancy may detain him he is found at home, lingering
around each scene with the familiarity of long acquaintance,
and a perfect knowledge of each object and allurement. He is ever
changing, too, in the visions he presents us. Now, he is hovering
over an ideal land, sweeping forward with a wing, which, like that of
the untiring Huma, is not folded upon earth. Now, he leads us forth
to gaze upon the witcheries of nature,&mdash;to view the gorgeous colorings
of her varied landscapes,&mdash;to break the silence of her forest
solitudes,&mdash;to tread the mountain height, or to repose beside the
streamlet that runs whimpering at its base. Again, he summons up
our energies for a still bolder flight&mdash;carries us away to the bright
fields of upper regions, onward and still onward, till our world is lost
in distance, and we walk upon the star-lit plains of heaven. Anon,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fleet as the swallow cuts the drift,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or sea-roc rides the blast,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>he plunges with us far within the bosom of the heaving deep, where
the wrath of the storm spirit is unheard&mdash;down to the coral towers of
“snail-plated” warriors, or around the amber beds of ocean sylphs
and mermaids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>But exuberance of fancy, though perhaps the most prominent, is
not the only quality inherent in these poems. We have before alluded
to the beauty of their rhythm. This we regard as almost
faultless. There is a fitness in the choice of each word, and a care
in its location, which imparts to every sentence a high finish and proportion.
Each line seems flowing onward, with a light and rapid
motion, as it were to blend in union with a graceful whole. There
are no rough corners that can meet us at the turn of each expression.
The eye reposes upon nothing but a surface of unbroken symmetry,
and the ear drinks in a music grateful as the murmurs of some meadow
stream. We may deny it, if we choose, but there is a “charm
in numbers,” and the one who holds it lightly is deficient in his judgment.
The profoundest argument that man can frame, or the proudest
monument of pure mind that he can offer, derives much of its
impressive force from the garb in which it is presented. Unadorned
it is the naked statue, modelled thus far by the youthful pupil, and
that needs a master’s polish to display it in perfection. The materials
for this statue, abstract intellect may, indeed must furnish, but
it yet demands the touches of a cultivated taste. That education
which has taught us how to reason has done well, but a different
knowledge should be added ere we reap its full advantage. He who
has cast loose from the firm rock of thought, that his bark may toss
on summer seas to fancied shores of pleasure, has exposed himself
to shipwreck&mdash;but as sad may be the fate of him, who, relying solely
on the native strength of his entrenchment, has erected there no
battery to render it impregnable. It would be a source of satisfaction,
did our time allow the privilege, to trace still farther the idea
which we have started, and to make its application to a multitude of
cases, but we leave it, with reluctance, to complete our undertaking.</p>

<p>As specimens of graceful diction, and an almost boundless play of
fancy, there are many of Drake’s pieces which remind us of the
brilliant compositions of another poet&mdash;one whose harp has breathed
forth strains than which there are none sweeter, and whose life has
been one revel around sentiment and song. Who of us can say,
whether the young poet of America might not have been to her
what Moore is now to Ireland&mdash;that he would have loved her with
less fervor of devotion, or have sounded forth her praises with a
feebler lyre. His would have been a soul to dwell upon her charms
with rapture, who when pleading for his parent soil exclaims,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Shame! that while every mountain, stream and plain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hath theme for truth’s proud voice or fancy’s wand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No <i>native</i> bard the patriot harp hath ta’en,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But left to minstrels of a foreign strand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To sing the beauteous scenes of nature’s loveliest land.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the numerous pieces which compose the volume, we select
the <span class="smcap">Culprit Fay</span>, as best adapted to exhibit the true merits of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
author. It is, to say the least, an elegant production&mdash;the purest
specimen of ideality that we have ever met with, sustaining in each
incident a most bewitching interest. Its very title is enough to kindle
the imagination, and to send us wandering amid the bowers of
elfin land, reviewing the traditions of our boyhood years. We recall
to recollection many of those “old world stories,”&mdash;tales of
brownies and the bogle burns of Scotland,&mdash;of the elves and sprites
of merry England, or the mystic Wasser Nixen of the German fable.
We trust ourselves with pleasure to that guidance which once more
will introduce us to this region of enchantment.</p>

<p>The poem opens with an elegant description of the spot our author
has selected for his “spell-bound realm.” It lies beside the waters
of the lordly Hudson&mdash;a river whose whole shore is rich in scenes
of beauty, and many of whose deep receding bays and jutting headlands
have derived a lasting interest from the pen of Irving. The
time is midnight&mdash;we stand upon the summit of Cronest, gazing
upon a cloudless sky&mdash;every thing around us is now lulled to sweet
repose&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The winds are whist, and the owl is still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The bat in the shelvy rock is hid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And naught is heard on the lonely hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the cricket’s chirp, and the answer shrill</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the gauze-winged katy-did.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the voice of the sentry-elf, awakened from his slumbers,
(how he came to be asleep our author does not tell us,) breaks in
upon the stillness, as he hastens to announce the dawning of the fairy
day&mdash;and crowds of tiny Fays fly answering to his summons.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They come from beds of lichen green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They creep from the mullen’s velvet screen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Some on the backs of beetles fly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the silver tops of moon-touched trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rocked about in the evening breeze;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Some from the hum-bird’s downy nest&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They had driven him out by elfin power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And pillowed on plumes of his rainbow breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had slumbered there till the charmed hour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Some had lain in the scoop of the rock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With glittering ising-stars inlaid;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And some had opened the four-o’-clock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stole within its purple shade.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And now they throng the moonlight glade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above&mdash;below&mdash;on every side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their little minim forms arrayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not, however, to the dance or revel that we are invited. No
wild gambol is to rivet our attention. We are summoned to the trial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of an erring ouphe. Before us stands the throne of judgment, supported
on its pillars of the “mottled tortoise shell,” and covered by
a curtain of the “tulip’s crimson drapery.” Upon it sits the fairy
monarch, surrounded by the nobles of his realm&mdash;before him is the
culprit Fay. Weighty is the crime alledged against the prisoner.
Unmindful of his vestal vow, he has dared to love an earthly maiden.
He has</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">&mdash;“left for her his woodland shade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has lain upon her lip of dew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sunned him in her eye of blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fanned her cheek with his wing of air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Played with the ringlets of her hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, nestling on her snowy breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgot the lily-king’s behest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His condemnation follows. The loveliness and purity of her for
whom he had thus sinned, go far to mitigate the punishment to which
he is obnoxious&mdash;a punishment than which none could be severer or
more terrible. His sentence is pronounced.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou shalt seek the beach of sand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the water bounds the elfin-land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou shalt watch the oozy brine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the sturgeon leaps in the bright moonshine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then dart the glistening arch below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And catch a drop from his silver bow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The water-sprites will wield their arms,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">If thy heart be pure and thy spirit right,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou shalt win the warlock fight.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With this explanation of the nature of his penance, we leave the
sentenced Fay to enter on his toilsome journey and meet us in its
progress at a different quarter.</p>

<p>We have heard often of the circumstances which led to the production
of this poem, and of the astonishing rapidity with which it
was composed. How this may be we know not. Judging from the
beauty of its several parts, and still more from its finish as a whole,
it strikes us as the result of long continued labor, polished and perfected
with a scrupulous attention. The subject which our author
has selected, is one admirably fitted to display his genius. It is one,
however, that demands unceasing effort, and requires the constant
workings of his brilliant fancy. From the ordinary range of illustration
he is certainly excluded, while the path to the attainment of
his object is both difficult and devious. He has drawn around himself
a magic circle, into which no human form can enter. Nothing
earthly is to mingle in the scenes to which he calls us. Each action,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
in its origin, continuance, and termination, must be fitted to the beings
he has chosen for his actors. With this view of his undertaking,
we may fear for the result, and watch with much anxiety its full accomplishment.
It is not long, however, that we feel this apprehension.
We soon discover that our author is prepared for each adventure&mdash;that
he gains a ready conquest over every opposition, while
his flight continues onward with an undiminished ardor.</p>

<p>Here again we are to greet our pilgrim fairy. Long and wearisome
have been his wanderings. Hour after hour has he toiled amid
the passes of the mountain, and fearful are the perils he has been
compelled to meet. He has followed out a dangerous track,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Through dreary beds of tangled fern,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through groves of nightshade dark and dern,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over the grass and through the brake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where toils the ant and sleeps the snake,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>till he has reached the spot appointed for the trial of his courage.
He has found the treasure that he sought, protected by the warriors
of the deep, and been baffled by their forces in the efforts he has
made.</p>

<p>It is in this crisis of affairs that we meet with a deliverance as
ingenious as it is successful. It is necessary, for our author’s purpose,
that his hero, though thus far defeated, should yet gain his object,
and with that intention he has brought him to his present situation.
The events which we have compressed into the narrow space
of a few lines, have been presented in detail up to the period in
which the Fay, driven from his purpose, stood despairing on the
river’s brink. It is thus the history continues,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He cast a saddened look around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But he felt new joy his bosom swell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, glittering on the shadowed ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He saw a purple muscle shell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thither he ran, and he bent him low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He heaved at the stern, and he heaved at the bow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he pushed her over the yielding sand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till he came to the verge of the haunted land.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She was as lovely a pleasure boat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As ever fairy had paddled in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For she glowed with purple paint without,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shone with silvery pearl within;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sculler’s notch in the stem he made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An oar he shaped of the bootle blade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then sprung to his seat with a lightsome leap,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And launched afar on the calm blue deep.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Guarded in this manner from the machinations of his enemies, whose
power was bounded by the wave, our adventurer holds on his course
uninjured, and effects his purpose. His return, surrounded by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
crowd of ocean nymphs, is beautifully represented. We refer our
readers to the volume for the passage.</p>

<p>Here the scene of this poem changes, and we find our Fay is still
destined to another duty&mdash;one far more difficult than any he has yet
accomplished. The remainder of his sentence now demands attention.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark,</div>

<p>The emotions which this burst of burning passion excited in the
doubting Fay, are well described. The remembrance of his earthly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
love, joined to the recollection of a sentence unperformed, enables
him at last to utter a reply declining even such enjoyment. The
impassioned queen, too generous to enforce her wishes, surrounds
him with a spell that guards from every evil, and then bids him a reluctant
and heart-felt adieu. Rapid is his progress to the termination
of his labors. The conflict is soon over, and the prize is won.
Already is he on the confines of his native land, and we listen to
the music that proclaims his welcome. Gladly would we follow
him still farther.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_DOUBLE_DISAPPOINTMENT">THE DOUBLE DISAPPOINTMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p class="h3sub">A TALE FROM SPANISH HISTORY.</p>

<p>No one, save he who has witnessed with a heart all susceptible to
the beauties of nature, can even picture to himself the delightful
scene of a summer’s evening in the fair region of Granada. The
mellowed tints of the declining sun gilding every object with a fairy
brightness; the gushing fountains sending forth their drops of ruby
light; the thick groves of citron and pomegranate, casting their deep
shadows in the distance, seemingly inviting to repose, almost transport
with rapture an inhabitant of our northern clime.</p>

<p>It was on such an evening, that a betrothed pair sat beneath the
marble arcade at the dwelling of the Alcalde of the district. Their
hearts seemed in unison with the delightful scene around them; their
words were music to each other’s ears; their thoughts were of bright
joys of the future,&mdash;and no one could have looked upon their innocent
embrace, or listened to their words of love, without deeming
their happiness complete. The youth rose to depart.</p>

<p>‘Nay, Muza, do not leave me yet,’ exclaimed the happy girl, as
she turned her bright, half-smiling, half-imploring eyes, upon her
lover; ‘but a short hour have we been together, and wilt thou leave
me so soon?’</p>

<p>‘Leave thee, Zareda? nay, I would never leave thee.’</p>

<p>‘Why then dost thou look thus anxiously towards Hafiz, as if
waiting but for thy steed to depart?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>‘Love, art not thou ever with me, as well in the raging of the
conflict and in the exultation of victory, as when, side by side, we
sit beneath the overhanging bower and by the cooling fountain? Am
not I still with thee; and do not the thoughts of thee lead me on to
glory? Allah be praised, that he has given me such a presiding angel.’</p>

<p>‘Thy praise is far too high, Muza, else, why shouldst thou not be
willing to pass some longer portion of thy time in the immediate
presence of such an angel?’</p>

<p>‘Love, think of our race, and lament not these too short moments
of bliss; our race, scorned and trampled upon by the Christian,
fast falling into the chains of slavery, and compelled to toil for him;&mdash;shall
we endure it? No! rather let the desert be our home,&mdash;the
home of our ancestors,&mdash;barren and desolate though it be, still may
we breathe the air of freedom.&mdash;Yes, my country needs my sword,
my country and my love. Do not then grieve for this short interview;
am not I wholly thine,&mdash;and will not to-morrow join us never
more to part? Farewell then, for a few short hours, made doubly
brief by thoughts of thee.’ So saying, Muza sprang lightly upon his
horse, which his faithful attendant had already led forward, and soon
disappeared behind the trees that o’erhung the path. Zareda stood
gazing in the direction, so long as the sound of trampling hoofs was
audible, as he flew over the plain, and then, full of bright anticipations
of the morrow, retired to her chamber.</p>

<p>That what follows may be readily understood, it is necessary to
state, that the incidents of the present sketch occurred about the year
1450, when Mohammed X. ruled over the kingdom of Granada,
but who, together with his people, was in turn experiencing the
ill fortunes of war from the increasing power of the Christians, as
had, nearly eight centuries before, the Goths from his predecessors.
Though, at the time of which we write, the army of the
Christians was not in force against them, still, a kind of partizan warfare
continued,&mdash;sometimes, indeed, to the temporary triumph of the
Moors, but always, eventually, to the permanent advantage of their
enemy. The Christian leaders, attended by a few hundred followers,
were continually ravaging the country; and one of them, Fernando
Narvaez, with less than two hundred men, had more than once
spread alarm to the very gates of Granada.</p>

<p>It was on the eve of an expedition of one of these partisan bands,
as some twenty cavalry were scouring the country, seizing upon such
travelers as were so unwary, or rather unfortunate, as to fall into
their hands, that upon turning an acclivity rising abruptly from the
road, and skirted by a grove of citrons, they came full upon a young
Moorish horseman, riding leisurely forward, as though unconscious
of danger. He appeared to be just in the prime of manhood; in
stature rather above middling, yet finely proportioned. His noble
bearing, together with the richness of his dress, proclaimed him a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
person of distinction and a warrior; his turban and scarf were
wrought of the most costly materials, and spangled with jewels,
whilst a sword and buckler of exquisite workmanship hung by his
side;&mdash;his horse was in every respect worthy of his rider. No sooner
did he perceive the band of the enemy, than he turned in flight
with the speed of the wind; winding rapidly round the edge of the
hill, until, for a moment, he was obscured from sight, he dashed
headlong into the grove, trusting to art and his knowledge of the
country to elude their pursuit. But escape was vain. They hurried
eagerly forward, piercing the grove in every direction, following
each winding path, and seized upon him as he was emerging from
the opposite side. Resistance he saw would be useless; but he
deigned not a word to his captors, and there was nought betrayed
emotion, save a slight curl of contempt upon his lip as he delivered
his arms into their hands, and quietly took his station, as he was bid,
between two of their number. They continued about an hour reconnoitering
the country, but no enemy appearing, returned to their
quarters, bringing with them their prisoner.</p>

<p>During this interval, the young Moor had had leisure to reflect
upon his situation. He was a brave warrior; and like every one
who is truly brave, he possessed not only a spirit of boldness and
daring during the raging of the battle, and in the hour of triumph,
but could yield to disappointment and defeat, and meet the reverses
of fortune with equal fortitude. So now, though he knew from the
first that slavery would be the mildest lot for which he could even
hope, nevertheless, he willingly yielded to necessity, and seemed to
the observer, as if regardless of his situation. But this appearance
was not long maintained;&mdash;a tinge of melancholy stole over his
countenance; the stern and fearless look of the warrior was changed
to the appearance of thoughtful anxiety and inward grief;&mdash;some
more powerful emotion, and apparently unconnected with the feelings
of a soldier, was working at his heart. Such was his situation
as they arrived at their quarters, and conducted him immediately to
the presence of their leader.</p>

<p>All the decision and sternness of a Spanish general was depicted
in the countenance of Narvaez. His authority was usually severe,
and his will not to be questioned; but, at times, he would exhibit a
natural disposition of kindness and benevolence, which endeared him
to his followers, and rendered him none the less fitted to command.</p>

<p>‘Who art thou?’ said he, as the prisoner was led before him,
‘and whither wert thou going, thus unattended, through a hostile
country?’</p>

<p>‘Christian,’ said the Moor, as he endeavored to assume an appearance
becoming his rank, but which, it was evident at the time,
cost him no slight exertion,&mdash;‘know that I am the son of the Alcalde
of Ronda; and I was going, this very night, to claim&mdash;’ but
the effort was too much for him; he burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>‘Thou astonishest me!’ cried Narvaez,&mdash;‘thy father I knew
well, and, though an enemy, yet will I acknowledge him as brave a
warrior as ever crossed a lance; but thou weepest like a woman!
Seest thou not that this is but one of the chances of war; one,
which thy noble father would have met, had fortune so ordered, with
as calm a brow as if greeted with the tribute of success? Is the son
so far degenerated from the sire!’</p>

<p>‘Nay, Christian,’ answered Muza, for it was he, ‘I hope in all
things to be worthy of the fame of my father; and among my own
people, the name of Muza ben Hassan is not spoken with contempt.
’Tis not for the loss of liberty that I grieve, but for something a
thousand times dearer than that, of which I must be deprived;’&mdash;and
as he concluded the sentence, his spirit, which for a moment
had been aroused by the taunting allusion to his degeneracy, sank
again. But Narvaez saw the marks of a noble mind within, as he
drew up his manly figure to its height, displaying to the best advantage
his finely proportioned limbs, whilst his brow contracted with a
look almost of defiance. He saw that there was something more
than his present misfortune which so powerfully affected him,&mdash;and
at once he became deeply interested in the youth.</p>

<p>‘And what is that,’ said he, as he saw him a little more composed,
‘which thou valuest at a price so much dearer than liberty?’</p>

<p>‘Know then, since thou wishest it, that I have long been in love
with the daughter of a neighboring Alcalde; that love was crowned
with success, and this very night was to have made her mine, but thy
arms have detained me. She is even now waiting in suspense, or
perhaps accusing me of inconstancy,&mdash;wretched, wretched fate!
would that I might see her yet once more.’</p>

<p>‘Noble cavalier! if thy wish is granted thee, wilt thou promise to
return before to-morrow’s sun?’</p>

<p>‘Allah bless thee, generous Christian!’ exclaimed Muza, overjoyed
at the proposal, ‘upon the word of a Moor, whose word, when
sincerely given, has never been broken, I promise faithfully to return.
Generosity, I see, belongs not to one race alone.’</p>

<p>‘Go then,&mdash;and remember thy promise,’ said Narvaez, as he gave
orders to permit him instantly to depart.</p>

<p>Let us change the scene, and introduce once more the fair lady
of our tale, whom we have already too long neglected. Throughout
the day all had been bustle and preparation in the house of her father.
The halls had been richly hung with tapestry, and put in
readiness for the giddy dance; the tables were loaded with the choicest
productions of that fruitful clime for the marriage banquet.
Zareda had been all gayety and happiness; but towards evening she
appeared more thoughtful, and her accustomed laugh and words of
mirth were no longer heard. She expected to have seen him ere
this, and to have met that embrace, which would crown all her love.
An hour passed away, yet still he came not:&mdash;her watchfulness was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
fast verging to anxiety. Another long half hour is gone&mdash;in gloomy
sadness she sat herself down ’neath the arcade, where they had so
often met together. ‘Why comes he not?&mdash;has any mischief befallen
him?&mdash;has he fallen into the hands of any marauding company
of the enemy? has he&mdash;can it be, that he has deserted me?&mdash;away,
ungrateful thought! it cannot be; some accident surely has overtaken
him.’ As these, and various like reflections, were passing in
her mind, a song of plaintive melancholy fell softly on her ear.</p>

</div>

<p>So deeply melancholy was the strain&mdash;so much in unison with her
own increasing fears, that Zareda recognized not the cheerful voice
of her Muza, till the song was finished, and he himself stood before
her.</p>

<p>‘Muza, is it thou?&mdash;thanks to Allah! now will we indeed be
happy. But why so late? Is this the eagerness with which to
meet thy bride?&mdash;or why didst thou fright me with that gloomy
song?’</p>

<p>‘Zareda, I am a prisoner; perhaps a slave&mdash;two hours ago I fell
into the hands of the enemy, and I am now to behold thee for the
last time.’</p>

<p>‘A prisoner! how so, even if thou hast been with the enemy,
since thou now standest here free before me? Thy bonds are loose
for a Christian’s hands to inflict. Oh Allah! hast thou too proved
faithless to thy country! art thou a&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Traitor! and from thee! Zareda, hear me: accuse me not of
faithlessness either to thee or to my country. Though I am now before
thee, still am I no less a prisoner; I must return before to-morrow’s
sun&mdash;my word is pledged. Then doubt me not, but take my
last farewell. Would that I might see <i>thee</i> happy; then would I
be content.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>‘I will not doubt thee, Muza. Oft hast thou given me proofs of
thy love, but this surpasses all.&mdash;Nay, thou shalt not say farewell;
I will go with thee, perhaps they may listen to my prayers. I have
wealth and jewels,&mdash;they shall purchase thy freedom, or together we
will share thy fate.’ Muza saw that to oppose her wishes would
only increase her zeal; and, though he had no hopes for his own
freedom, he knew that to her at least no injury would be suffered by
his enemies. Zareda was soon in readiness to depart, and long before
morning they had arrived at the station of their enemy. Narvaez
was ready to receive them.</p>

<p>‘Ha,’ exclaimed he, as Muza again appeared before him, supporting
on his arm the trembling Zareda, ‘thou hast brought thy mistress
with thee, to cheer thy spirits, and soften the ills of confinement?’</p>

<p>‘Christian,’ said Zareda in a faltering voice, falling at the feet of
Narvaez, ‘if thou hast an eye to pity, a heart to feel, do not separate
us. Here is money: here are jewels&mdash;take them all, but let
<i>him</i> go free.’</p>

<p>‘Generous maiden, fear not;’ and he raised her gently as he
spoke;&mdash;‘thy devotedness is worthy the fidelity of thy lover. Cruel
should I indeed be, had I the heart to mar such happiness as is in
store for thee. Go, and may ye both live long to enjoy your happiness.’</p>

<p>But the goodness of Narvaez was not alone manifested in words.
He loaded them with presents, and furnished an escort to conduct
them in safety to Ronda. And long was the name of Narvaez celebrated
in song and romance, as the <i>generous-hearted Christian</i>.</p>

<p>Bless thee, reader&mdash;Let us live and love, since brief is our time
for either. <i>Of course</i>, I wish to please thee. I might make a huge
boast of independence: but the boast would be as false as foolish. I
might feign contempt of thee, and of the public: but it would be a
wicked lie. So far as I am an author, <i>thy</i> smiles, and <i>their</i> favor,
are my life. I may read, think, act, to please myself; but it is clear
that <i>I write</i> to please thee. This blows sky-high all scornful prefaces,
such as some modern authors paste on the foreheads of their
little bantlings, which they send forth to angle for favor in the muddy
and shifting stream of popular applause. How mortified are these
scribbling autocrats, when their very <i>cartels</i> of defiance are unanswered,
and unread! Yet, on the other hand, is there something
of courtesy,&mdash;nay, of indulgence, due to him, who neither assumes,
nor dictates, but offers, in the words, and with the spirit of humility,
what he hopes may please, and possibly instruct. I steal not&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
borrow not. Scanty though be my cloak in breadth, and coarse in
texture, yet I wove it in mine own loom, and with mine own hands.
Whatever I give is mine, or rather, <i>was</i>&mdash;for it is <i>thine</i> now. It is
all I have&mdash;the widow’s mite&mdash;and, as such, receive it. I would
not bring a “vain oblation” to the literary altar&mdash;that blood-stained
shrine, on which so many a helpless victim is dissected by unfeeling
butchers. I have not time to give thee much, (I fear me thou art
not sorry,) nor can I ‘lick into shape’ what I <i>do</i> give.</p>

<p>I have thought of essaying a few remarks on the principles of
translation, and the practice of translators, that thou be not inordinately
surprised, if on comparing my version with the original, thou
dost not find in both <i>all</i> the same words, and in the same order&mdash;meeting,
tooth to tooth. I do so to satisfy the scruples of the well-disposed,
and not to blunt the arrows of small-beer wit, or to elude
the aim of pop-gun ammunition. “Out! out! brief candle!” says
the immortal Shakspeare. “Get out! get out! you short candle!”
says the spruce Frenchman. The Frenchman was <i>literal</i>; but he
had better have understood the <i>spirit</i> of his author, and given that,
though it were with a periphrasis. The truth is, you cannot render
any passage in a Greek or Latin poem <i>religiously</i> into English&mdash;preserving
the precise form, attitude, expression and size&mdash;if you attempt
the absurdity, you present to the eyes of your readers, not a
living body, but a lifeless corpse. All, that can be done with works
written among nations at so wide a remove from our own in age,
character, customs, and religion, is to breathe the spirit and manner
of the original into English as elegant, yet close and strong as possible.
Their works are full of phrases and allusions, which, with us,
are dry and barren, while to them they were instinct with poetry,
and eloquent with meaning. To the heart of the Grecian the history
of his country was sanctified, and made dear by a long line of
traditionary glories. Familiar to them, though lost to us, were a
thousand memories of mystic interest, and patriotic pride&mdash;tales of
the gods and heroes, who had lived and moved in their land, amid
the days of its splendor&mdash;histories woven from facts, but tinged in
the multitudinous colorings of fancy&mdash;fables, that stretched far back
through the haze of ages, from wonder to doubt, and from doubt to
darkness. Here had Jupiter been cradled in the mountains&mdash;there
gushed a fountain from the foot-print of Neptune’s charger&mdash;here,
from the sown teeth of the slaughtered dragon, sprang to life and fell
in battle a field of steel-clad warriors&mdash;and there had Orpheus
charmed the stones to life, and made the forests dance in chorus to
his lyre. These were so many chords of interest, which the poet
had but to touch, and the souls of his readers responded with a thrill.
Now all these springs of passion are sealed to us&mdash;for, in the first
place, the history of another and a buried nation excites but a feeble
sympathy, compared with that which ponders and glows above our
own&mdash;and, secondly, we rarely feel deeply what we do not thoroughly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
believe, or fully comprehend. Deprived, then, of these advantages,
unaided by fancy, and unadorned by language, a translation
would be about as <i>touching</i> as a table of <i>tangents</i>. And this is
what has made English translations so insipid compared with English
originals, and has induced in some the belief that even the
master-pieces of antiquity are poor and pointless&mdash;the fondled god-children
of pedantic book-worms. This deficiency the translator
must labor to supply. It is to be supplied&mdash;not by stripping the
original of its <i>nationality</i>, and making it apply as well to New England
as to Greece&mdash;but by preserving it bold, free, and spirited, as
it is in its native language&mdash;by clothing it in words sufficiently glowing
and graceful to arouse sympathy, yet exhibiting, through all, the
body of the original, like a lamp flame, shining through its glassy
vase&mdash;in short, by having it still Greek, but English-Greek.</p>

<p>This accords with the practice of all the best translators. No
translator ever gave, or intended to give every word, or even shade
of idea, that he found in the original. I appeal with confidence to
any page in Dryden, or Cowley, in Addison, or Pope. They have,
I acknowledge, generally carried their <i>liberality</i> to a fault&mdash;still, if
<i>they</i> do not translate correctly, who does? Open at any page of
Pope&mdash;say the last four lines of the Iliad. Read the simple original.
“And after having heaped up the (sepulchral) mound, they
went back. And then, happily assembled, they banqueted upon a
very splendid banquet in the dwelling of Priam, Jove-nourished
king. Thus did they attend to the burial of Hector, tamer-of-horses.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“All Troy then moves to Priam’s court again,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And peaceful slept the mighty Hector’s shade.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Too wide, I grant&mdash;yet it is Pope, the king of translators.</p>

<p>Addison, dear reader, was not a bad translator. Yet take his rendering
of that grand Horatian&mdash;the third of the third book. “Not
the heat of the citizens, commanding crooked things, not the countenance
of an urgent tyrant, shakes in his solid mind the man just
and firm to his purpose.”</p>

<p>He has rendered literally but four words, and them I have italicised.
Is it, therefore, a bad translation? No. It is good&mdash;though,
with all due deference to thy shade, Oh! Joseph, I must think it a
<i>little</i> diffuse&mdash;still, it is good, because it expresses the spirit and manner
of the original in fine, forcible English. I give thee a literal

<p>“Charles K.” is a well written tale, and, as it is apparently founded
upon facts, would undoubtedly interest those personally acquainted
with the scenes which it describes; but, unless we misjudge, it would
strike others differently.</p>

<p>“Evening Thoughts,” an article on William Wirt, and a “Sonnet,”
are declined.</p>

<p>“The Seminole,” with some metrical alterations, may appear in
our next.</p>

<p>“A Rhyming Mood,” is accepted.</p>

<p>The author of “Niobe,” and “Spring,” (we suppose them both
from the same pen,) would do well to use the ‘<i>file</i>’ a little more
freely, and also, read, at his leisure, a chapter or two of some treatise
on <i>Perspicuity</i>.</p>

<p>“My Village Home,” “The Pleasures of Innocence,” and “The
Future,” (which, from the <i>paper</i> and chirography, we judge to be
the productions of one and the same intellect,) might, perhaps, be
creditable to the powers of an Infant School poet; but, <i>Dii Immortales!</i>

<p>An <i>apology</i> for establishing a Literary Magazine, in an institution
like Yale College, can hardly be deemed requisite by an enlightened
public; yet a statement of the objects which are proposed
in this Periodical, may not be out of place.</p>

<p>To foster a literary spirit, and to furnish a medium for its exercise;
to rescue from utter waste the many thoughts and musings of
a student’s leisure hours; and to afford some opportunity to train
ourselves for the strife and collision of mind which we must expect
in after life;&mdash;such, and similar motives have urged us to this undertaking.</p>

<p>So long as we confine ourselves to these simple objects, and do
not forget the modesty becoming our years and station, we confidently
hope for the approbation and support of all who wish well
to this institution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The work will be printed on fine paper and good type. Three
numbers to be issued every term, each containing about 40 pages,
8vo.</p>

<p><i>Conditions</i>&mdash;$2,00 per annum, if paid in advance, or 75 cents
at the commencement of each term.</p>

<p>Communications may be addressed through the Post Office, “To
the Editors of the Yale Literary Magazine.”</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
